It's just another memory.

This is first big programm writted by myself in ~2010-2012. This is last version of it.

This is bot programm for MMORPG LineAge 2. He's working with memory of game process and read it. This bot can farm, use skills, macros, cooldowns, auto rebuff (also on freeshards with ALT+B buffer), auto CP/HP/MP (as 'cheat' for pvp) and so on. He's can moving for long distance, only on single spot.

This bit is undetectable (!) for most (~99.99%) of cheat guards. I think, the only problem is Frost from Innova Systems. Cuz it 'read' memory, and send kepyress, hes cannot be deteceted. I got 0 bans for using it every day :)

The bot works only on server for which configured. Cuz every chronicles, patches and .exe files has diffirent builds, they have diffirent memory locations. So you must edit Memory Offsets in code for you servers, compile it and then using. All other is will be great. If you don't know how to find memory offsets, i wrote i simple [example here](https://github.com/Hofls/l2DogeBot/blob/master/info/How%20find%20values%20in%20memory.md). I recoommend to  use CheatEngine.

Writted in Delphi 7, then in RAD Delphi studio. I think there is no diffrenece what to use.
